              Major League Baseball (MLB) is unique in the fact that teams do not have a cap for how
              much they can pay their players, so each team can spend as much as they want on player
              salaries. This can be a bit controversial, because fans might begin to think that the
              team that spends the most money is guaranteed to win the most. History shows that this
              is not always the case, and thus the purpose of this visualization is to present users
              with data that tells the story of what teams are most successful at efficiently
              spending money.

              The goals for this data visualization are to be simple enough that someone with
              limited baseball knowledge will understand what the data is telling them, but to also
              have the right variables captured so that someone with a deeper knowledge can extract
              unique insights. Additionally, this data visualization could possibly help inform team
              management about what financial strategies tend to yield the most success in the MLB.
