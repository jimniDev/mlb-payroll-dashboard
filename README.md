Major League Baseball (MLB) is unique in the fact that teams do not have a cap for how much they can pay their players, so each team can spend as much as they want on player salaries. This can be a bit controversial, because fans might begin to think that the team that spends the most money is guaranteed to win the most. History shows that this is not always the case, and thus the purpose of this visualization is to present users with data that tells the story of what teams are most successful at efficiently spending money.
